Growing up, I have always been fascinated by any sort of tech that was around me. Whether it came in the form the of the family computer or a game system I had at the time like the Nintendo 64, you would always see me nearby it. I will always remember the first time that I turned on the family computer for the first time and hearing the Windows Vista startup sound. 

From that moment on, my love for tech has carried on year after year. This interest I had from when I was a kid has now lead me to the University of Illinois Chicago. I now know how to code in several different types of programming languages like C++ and Java, and have created multiple projects out of them. Now as graduation keeps getting closer and closer, I want to use those skills that I have acquired and bring them to a company that I can support and help grow.
